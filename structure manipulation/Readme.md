A.	Your program must store this information in an array of struct product type. You must declare the struct product_type. (HINT: You can make any other structures or arrays of structures that you think might help you solve this problem.) Your program should display product information in tabular format which should contain product number, product name and retail price (as shown below).			[10 Marks]
B.	Your program should ask the user to enter the number of products they want to purchase (you must validate this number). Then for each product that user wants to purchase your program should ask the user to enter the product numbers and the quantity to be purchased (as shown below).			[10 Marks]
C.	Your program must validate the Product numbers entered by the user whether that product number exists in the table or not. If the product number does not exist in the table then it should ask the user to enter correct product number (as shown below). It should also validate the product quantity to see if there is enough product to complete the order. If there is insufficient quantity, it should inform the user and fill the order with as many product quantities as possible (as shown below).						[10 Marks]
D.	Your program should display product number, product name, retail price, quantity purchased, calculate and display the Amount (retail price x quantity purchase) of each product sold and calculate the total bill for all the products sold. It should NOT display zero quantity products or zero total amount (as shown below).													[10 Marks]
E.	The program should keep asking the user if he wants to order any other products until the user indicates that he does not want to order more products and wants to quit the program (as shown below).	[5 Marks]
F.	Your program should be properly indented and be properly commented			[5 Marks]
You need to write at least three different functions, one to display the products, one to calculate and print the bill and one to check the order quantities against the stock quantities.
The sample display below shows an example of how your output should look like.
