assume there are 10 closed lockers and 10 students in a room (user can enter the number of lockers)
first student goes and opens every locker
second student goes and changes the state( if it's opened he closes it and if it's closed he opens it) of each even number of locker
third student goes and changes the state of every third locker and so on
this program tells which locker will remain open in the end
